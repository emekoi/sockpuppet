# sockpuppet
i needed sockets but i didn't want to write all the code myself. so i went and "stole" code from [here](https://github.com/saprykin/plibsys).

## usage
see `sockaddr.h` and `socket.h` if you want to use this libray. there is an example in `example/`. to build it run `sh build.sh.bat [name of example]` if you are on unix or `./build.sh.bat [name of example]` if you are in a mingw-like environment. it should without one though. i think.
